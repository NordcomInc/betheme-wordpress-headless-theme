Migrate to headless WordPress without losing access to the Betheme BeBuilder.

== Description ==

A headless child theme to the famous Betheme by Muffin Group,
take your site to the next level with a WordPress headless theme.

Start migrating away from php without loosing access your current
tooling, like BeBebuilder. This theme handles the redirection and
even allows you to embed parts of your old WordPress site on your
fancier new headless frontend.

Designed to work perfectly with [WPGraphQL BeBuilder](https://github.com/NordcomInc/wp-graphql-bebuilder).

Initially based on [@nordcom/wordpress-headless-theme](https://github.com/NordcomInc/wordpress-headless-theme).

== NOTE ==

This is a theme for a __headless__ WordPress setup, the point
of it is to disable the frontend except for post/page previews and
if you're using the embeding feature during migration.

== Changelog ==

= 0.1.0 =
* Initial release!
* Optional support for embeding pages by using the `iframe` query parameter.
* See `Headless configuration` in the theme customizer for all the options.
